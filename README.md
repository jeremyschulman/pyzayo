# Python client for Zayo API

This package provides a basic python 3.8 asyncio based client to access the Zayo
API system.

# Installation

This package is not in PyPI as this time.  You will need to install it directly
from github using:

```bash
git clone git+
```
# Before You Begin

You must export two environment variables for use with this library:

  * `ZAYO_CLIENT_ID` - Your unique client ID value
  * `ZAYO_CLIENT_SECRET` - Your unique client secret value
  
You must obtain these values from Zayo.
